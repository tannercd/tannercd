## Hi there!

I like to write code and build things for the web. I'm currently focused on learning more about web performance, accessibility guidelines and Static Site Generators (SSG). 

I'm also frequently reading and sometimes writing about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 11ty, macOS, security and performance.
